----[Release Notes]-------------------------------------:

Hell is an experiment you can't survive in Outlast and 
the DLC Whistleblower. Explore Mount Massive Asylum and 
try to survive long enough to discover its terrible 
secret... if you dare.

In the remote mountains of Colorado, horrors wait inside
Mount Massive Asylum. A long-abandoned home for the 
mentally ill, recently re-opened by the "research and 
charity" branch of the transnational Murkoff 
Corporation, the asylum has been operating in strict 
secrecyâ€¦ until now. Acting on a tip from an anonymous 
source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into 
the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying 
line between science and religion, nature and something 
else entirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies
with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.

Continue to explore the dark world of the Murkoff 
Corporation with the included Outlast: Whistleblower 
DLC. You will play as Waylon Park, a software engineer 
under contract with Murkoff and the man who emailed 
journalists around the world - including Miles - at the 
beginning of Outlast. Spending a couple of weeks at 
Mount Massive, during which he was unable to even talk 
to his wife and son thanks to strict security 
protocols, Waylon developed a deep-seated distrust of 
the profit-motivated scientists and doctors leading 
dangerous and irresponsible experiments on their 
patients. Identifying with those poor souls fueled 
Waylon's anger, and set the stage for his unmasking of
Mount Massive's rotten core. Although Whistleblower 
tells the story that led to Outlast, it will actually 
stretch past the events of the first game to show the 
final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.

Outlast and the Outlast: Whistleblower DLC is a true 
survival horror experience which aims to show that the 
most terrifying monsters of all come from the human 
mind.

Features:

True Survival Horror Experience: You are no fighter - 
if you want to survive the horrors of the asylum, your 
only chance is to run... or hide

Immersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players 
a detailed, terrifying world to explore

Hide and Sneak: Stealth-based gameplay, with 
parkour-inspired platforming elements

Unpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when - and 
from where - one of the asylum's terrifying inhabitants 
will finally catch up to them

Real Horror: Outlast's setting and characters are 
inspired by real asylums and cases of criminal insanity
